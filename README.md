## Battleship
Browser-based Battleship app built using React and pure JavaScript through a TDD model.

Players, the gameboard, and player ships are generated through JavaScript factories. They are displayed on the webpage through React.

User plays against an AI enemy and is able to autoplace ships on their grid automatically.

## How to Play
- Autoplace your ships by clicking the refresh icon next to your grid until you are happy with your ship placement or manually place your ships by dragging and dropping them from your sidebar onto your grid
- You will always have the first turn, so click on any cell on your Opponent's grid to start
- The game will end once all enemy ships have been sunk or all your ships have been sunk
- To play again, click the refresh icon at the top of the page
